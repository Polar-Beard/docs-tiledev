## <a id="features"></a> Features

New features and changes in this release:

### <a id='consul-server'></a> Consul Server Instance Removed from PAS

The consul server instance is removed from PAS. This saves VM resources and reduces maintenance for managing a clustered component.

In PAS v2.4, the instance count for consul server VMs was scaled down to zero. This allowed the consul server to continue to provide the consul link for tiles that consume it. In PAS v2.7, the consul server instance is removed from PAS. 

For information about breaking changes caused by the removal of the consul server instance, see [Consul Clients Not Supported in PAS](#consul-clients-not-supported).

+ The Ops Manager syslog template now supports service broker tiles.

### <a id='consul-clients-not-supported'></a> Consul Clients Not Supported in PAS

The consul server instance is removed from PAS. Tiledev authors must remove any consul clients from their products to avoid failed deployments.

To remove consul clients from your products, make the following changes to any `job_type` that is colocated with `consul_agent`:

```
- name: consul_agent
    release: consul
    ...
    manifest: |
      ...
      consul:
        client:
          enabled: "(( $ops_manager.dns_enabled ? false : true ))"
```

For more information about removing consul clients from your products, see [Tile Authors Must Remove consul_agent](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-4/release-notes.html#breaking-consul) in the PCF v2.4 Partner Release Notes.
