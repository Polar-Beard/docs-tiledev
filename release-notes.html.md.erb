<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes the changes that Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v2.5 introduces
which might be relevant to partner service tiles.

## <a id="features"></a> Features

New features and changes in this release:

### <a id="syslog-form"></a> Tile Authors Can Migrate Syslog Forms

Tile authors with an existing syslog form can migrate their syslog parameters to a templatized Syslog form.
For more about migrating an existing form to the Ops Manager provided syslog form, see
[Migrating Existing Syslog Configuration to Ops Manager](./migrating-syslog-configuration.html).

For information about the [Syslog Form Template Available for Tile Authors](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-4/release-notes.html#syslog).

### <a id="forward-debug"></a>  Forward Ops Manager Debug Logs to An External Store in the Syslog Form
You can choose to forward logs generated by debugging processes to an external source by selecting a checkbox in the Syslog form of the Ops Manager **Settings** page. Forwarded logs are delivered to whatever external location you choose to receive other types of logs from Ops Manager.

To forward logs, select **Forward Debug Logs** in the **Syslog** pane. **Forward Debug Logs** is deselected by default. This is because debug logs can require a great deal of storage capacity. If you choose to use this option, ensure you have sufficient storage to contain the generated logs.

For more information about the Ops Manager Syslog pane, see [Settings Page](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/customizing/pcf-interface.html#settings) in the *Using the Ops Manager Interface* topic.

### <a id="rsyslog"></a> Custom Rsyslog Configuration Available in Ops Manager Syslog Template
You can customize Syslog behavior by adding configuration options in **Custom rsyslog Configuration** in the Ops Manager **Settings** pane. With this optional field you can add more rules for syslog configuration.

If you add custom rsyslog rules and select **Forward Debug Logs**, the rules are applied before logs are forwarded.
For more information about **Forward Debug Logs**, see [Forward Ops Manager Debug Logs to An External Store in the Syslog Form](#forward-debug) above.

For more information about the Ops Manager Syslog pane, see [Settings Page](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/customizing/pcf-interface.html#settings) in the *Using the Ops Manager Interface* topic.

### <a id="asynch-service-bindings"></a>  Apps Manager Supports Asynchronous Service Bindings
Apps Manager supports services that take advantage of the flexibility of asynchronous bindings. Asynchronous bindings provide service brokers more time to do the operations required to complete a bind. 
This can help service brokers avoid timing out for synchronous operations in PAS.

When you bind an app to a service that uses asynchronous bindings, Apps Manager displays the status of the service while the bind is still pending.

For more information about asynchronous operations in services, see the [Open Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/blob/v2.13/spec.md#synchronous-and-asynchronous-operations) documentation in GitHub.

### <a id="mysql-jobs"></a> mysql-restore and mysql-backup Jobs Are Removed

PAS v2.5 does not use the `mysql-restore` and `mysql-backup` jobs to internally back up MySQL. 
Instead, each BOSH job is backed up separately with BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR). `

For more information about BBBR, 
see [Backing Up and Restoring Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/customizing/backup-restore/).


### <a id="pas-properties"></a> Pivotal Application Service Tile Property Changes

Properties in the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) v2.5 tile have changed.
Tile developers must change any `(( ..cf.PROPERTY.NAME ))` calls accordingly if their tiles access
PAS property values.

The following tables list the properties that Pivotal removed and added in PAS v2.5:

<table id='removed' border="1" class="nice" >

## <a id="ki"></a> Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

### <a id="service-broker"></a> Ops Manager Syslog Template is Not Supported for Service Broker Tiles
Ops Manager Syslog template does not propagate to service broker tiles. Tile developers with service broker tiles should continue to use their own Syslog configurations. Service broker tiles with the Syslog template configured do not display the Syslog template.

For more information about the Syslog template, see 
[Syslog Form Template Available for Tile Authors](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-4/release-notes.html#syslog).

## <a id="breaking-changes"></a> Breaking Changes

This release has the following breaking changes:

### <a id="xenial"></a> Tile Authors Must Use Xenial Stemcells
Canonical will end support for Ubuntu Trusty Tahr on April 30th, 2019 and security fixes will no longer be backported. 
In PCF 2.5, Trusty stemcells are not supported. 
Tile authors should immediately start testing with the Xenial stemcells and fix any compatibility issues. 

For more information, see [Tile Authors Must Use Xenial Stemcells](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-4/release-notes.html#breaking-stemcells).

### <a id="cflinux"></a> PAS Only Supports cflinuxfs3

In PAS v2.5, `cflinuxfs3` is the only supported stack
and the `cflinuxfs2` stack is not included. 
If you are using the `cflinuxfs2` stack, you must migrate your app to `cflinuxfs3` before upgrading 
to PAS v2.5.

For more information, see [Tile Authors Must Manually Migrate Apps to cflinuxfs3](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-4/release-notes.html#breaking-cflinuxfs3).

### <a id="log-sys"></a> Removed Logging System Property
PAS v2.5 removes the **Syslog Drain Buffer Size** checkbox from the **Logging System** pane of the PAS tile. This field corresponds to a deprecated property that does not have any affect on the logging system when configured.

It also removes the corresponding property, `doppler.message_drain_buffer_size`. 
If you have any scripts that reference this property, they might fail.

### <a id="log-cache"></a> Removed Log Cache Property

PAS v2.4 removed the **Enable log-cache** checkbox from the **Advanced Features** section of the PAS tile.

PAS v2.5 removes the corresponding property, `enable_log_cache`. 
If you have any scripts that reference this property, they might fail.

### <a id="override-deploy"></a> Removed Option to Override Deployment Name to CF

PAS v2.4 introduced the use of `cf-GUID` as the value for the `deployment` in metrics. 
For more information, see [Uniquely Identify Metrics by Tile](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-4/release-notes.html).

PAS v2.4 also included the option to override this value back to cf, which was used in previous versions. However, PAS v2.5 removes this override option.

To upgrade successfully, **Use “cf” as deployment name in emitted metrics instead of unique name** in the **Advanced Features** pane of the PAS tile must be deselected.

If you have scripts that use metrics with `cf` as the value for `deployment`, your scripts might break when upgrading to PAS v2.5.

If you have PCF Healthwatch installed and you changed the value of **Use “cf” as deployment name in emitted metrics instead of unique name** in PAS, you must run the **Push Monitoring Components** errand for PCF Healthwatch to detect the change.

### <a id="unused-uaa"></a> Removed Unused Apps Manager UAA Client and Property

PAS v2.5 removes an unused Apps Manager UAA client identified as `portal` and an unused refresh token property `uaa.apps_manager_refresh_token_lifetime`.

If you have platform automation scripts that reference these properties, you might need to update them.

### <a id="traffic"></a> Removed Traffic Controller Container Metrics Endpoint

PAS v2.5 removes the Traffic Controller `containermetrics/app-guid` endpoint. 
If you have scripts that reference this endpoint, they might fail.

The `containermetrics/app-guid` endpoint provided access to container metrics from Traffic Controller for a specific app. In PAS v2.5, you can access container metrics through Log Cache. Log Cache includes API endpoints and a CLI plugin to query and filter logs and metrics.

To download the Log Cache Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) plugin, see [log-cache](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/#log-cache) in the cf CLI Plugins documentation. For information about using the Log Cache API, see [Log Cache](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/log-cache#restful-api-via-gateway) on GitHub.

### <a id="dns-servers"></a> Removed dns_servers Property Breaks Platform Automation Scripts
PAS v2.4 removed **DNS Servers** from the PAS UI. 
PAS v2.5 removes the corresponding `dns_servers property`. 
If this parameter is configured in your tiles, platform automation scripts fail.
